# EnemySoundLogsExtractor.exe

## Overview

**EnemySoundLogsExtractor.exe** is a simple tool designed to process Unity game logs, specifically those generated by the BepInEx modding framework.  
It reads the main log file and extracts every enemy sound event, saving logs into separate files named after each enemy (mob) inside a dedicated `EnemyLogs` folder.

This is useful for organizing and analyzing audio events by enemy type during gameplay or debugging.

## Installation

1. Download or build the `EnemySoundLogsExtractor.exe`.
2. Place the executable anywhere convenient.

## Usage

- Run `EnemySoundLogsExtractor.exe` in any directory.
