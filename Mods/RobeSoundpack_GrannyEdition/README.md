# RobeSoundpack: Granny Edition

> *"Granny wants to give you some snacks."* – and some scream-inducing nightmares.

This mod replaces the default sounds of the **Robe** enemy in R.E.P.O. with eerie and absurd custom sound effects inspired by Granny. All major Robe audio events are covered — from whispers to full attacks.
